# CSS_Art-Fifth-Element

This project is the first of a series of projects where I emulate various posters/artwork using HTML and CSS.  The Fifth Element is one of my favorite movies, 
and so I was really excited to find this poster a few years ago.  It's a minimalistic representation of Leeloo's costume when we first encounter her--what appears
to be a set of thermal bands (the white stripes in the poster).
